    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>LocoMotorApps</strong> built the <strong>Einbürgerungstest - 2025</strong> app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by <strong>LocoMotorApps</strong> at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

    <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the terms described in this policy.</p>

    <h2><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h2>

    <p>This application is designed for offline use. It <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information</strong> from its users. All quiz progress or user interactions (like selecting answers or viewing questions) are processed and stored, if at all, solely on the user's own device and are not accessible by <strong>LocoMotorApps</strong> or any third party through this app.</p>

    <p>The app does <strong>not</strong> require any special device permissions to function.</p>

    <p>The app may use third-party libraries solely for core functionality. These libraries do not collect personally identifiable information through their use in this app.</p>

    <h2><strong>Log Data</strong></h2>

    <p>This application <strong>does not collect Log Data</strong>. Since the app operates offline and does not include third-party analytics or crash reporting services, information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, usage times, or error statistics are <strong>not</strong> collected by <strong>LocoMotorApps</strong>.</p>

    <h2><strong>Content Source</strong></h2>

    <p>Our app includes a variety of practice questions for the Einbürgerungstest. These questions are based on publicly available materials related to the official test framework for different states of Germany.</p>

    <h2><strong>Data Retention and Data Deletion Policy</strong></h2>

    <p>As this application does not collect or store any personally identifiable information or user-specific data accessible to the developer, there is no server-side data to retain or delete. Any usage data (like answered questions within a session) resides only temporarily on the user's device during app use and may be cleared by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's data through the device settings.</p>

    <h2><strong>Cookies</strong></h2>

    <p>This Service <strong>does not use “cookies”</strong> either explicitly or through third-party code, as it operates offline and does not interact with websites in a way that requires cookies.</p>

    <h2><strong>Service Providers</strong></h2>

    <p>We <strong>do not employ</strong> third-party companies or individuals to facilitate our Service, provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used in a way that grants them access to any user data (as none is collected centrally).</p>

    <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2>

    <p>We value your trust. As the app operates offline and does not collect personal data, the risks associated with online data transmission and storage are inherently minimized. Standard Android platform security measures protect the app's local operational data on your device.</p>

    <h2><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></h2>

    <p>This Service <strong>does not contain links</strong> to external websites.</p>

    <h2><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></h2>

    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has used this app and you have concerns, please contact us. As the app does not collect personal information, there is no data stored by us regarding any user, including children.</p>

    <h2><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h2>

    <p>Please note that this app is an independent educational tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way associated with the official government agencies responsible for the Einbürgerungstest. While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information based on publicly available resources, we cannot guarantee that the content in this app fully reflects the latest official test questions, formats, or guidelines. Users are encouraged to consult the official resources and websites (such as those provided by BAMF or relevant state authorities) for the most current and authoritative information. Use this app at your own discretion and understand that it serves as a supplementary study aid, not a replacement for official preparation materials or advice from qualified professionals.</p>
