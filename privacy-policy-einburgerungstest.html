    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>LocoMotorApps</strong> built the <strong>Einbürgerungstest - 2025</strong> app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by <strong>LocoMotorApps</strong> at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

    <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h2>

    <p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain non-personally identifiable information. The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you indirectly or analyze app usage.</p>

    <p>Specifically, this app uses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> To understand how users engage with our application (e.g., frequency of use, events within the app, usage patterns, performance data, download source). This helps us improve the app's functionality and user experience. Firebase Analytics may collect device information (like model, OS version), potentially unique device identifiers (where applicable and allowed), and general location information (based on IP address). Data may be transmitted to and stored by Google. You can find more about Google's data practices here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> and Firebase privacy here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To report crashes and errors, helping us improve app stability. When a crash occurs, Crashlytics collects information such as device state, unique device identifiers (where applicable), and stack traces. This data is used solely for diagnosing and fixing issues. More information can be found in the Firebase and Google privacy policies linked above.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> To display advertisements within the app, which supports its free availability. AdMob may collect and use data such as device identifiers (like Google's Advertising ID), IP address, and general location information to serve personalized ads. Users in applicable regions will be presented with a consent choice regarding personalized advertising. For more details on how Google uses data for advertising, please visit: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Quiz progress or user interactions like selecting answers are primarily processed and stored locally on the user's device. While analytics and ad data is sent to third-party services, LocoMotorApps does not directly access personally identifiable information beyond aggregated, anonymized trends and crash reports.</p>

    <h2><strong>Log Data</strong></h2>

    <p>While the app itself does not create traditional server log files accessible by LocoMotorApps, the third-party services we use (Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and AdMob) do collect data related to your app usage and device when you use the Service. This can include information such as your device's approximate IP address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, error details (for Crashlytics), and other statistics. The app also makes network requests to update its question database, but this process does not involve the collection of personal user data by LocoMotorApps.</p>

    <h2><strong>Content Source</strong></h2>

    <p>Our app includes a variety of practice questions for the Einbürgerungstest. These questions are based on publicly available materials related to the official test framework for different states of Germany.</p>

    <h2><strong>Data Retention and Data Deletion Policy</strong></h2>

    <p>Data collected by Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, and AdMob is retained according to Google's data retention policies. LocoMotorApps does not store this data directly. For information on Google's data retention, please refer to their respective privacy policies. Any usage data stored locally on the user's device (like answered questions within a session) resides only temporarily and may be cleared by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's data through the device settings.</p>

    <h2><strong>Cookies</strong></h2>

    <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>

    <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app uses third-party code and libraries (Firebase, AdMob) that may use “cookies” or similar technologies (like device identifiers) to collect information and improve their services.</p>

    <h2><strong>Service Providers</strong></h2>

    <p>We employ third-party companies and individuals (Google via Firebase and AdMob) for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service (Crashlytics for stability);</li>
        <li>To provide the Service analysis on our behalf (Analytics);</li>
        <li>To display advertisements (AdMob);</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to certain data as described in the "Information Collection and Use" and "Log Data" sections. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose according to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2>

    <p>We value your trust in providing us your information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. We rely on the security measures provided by Google for the data collected through Firebase and AdMob. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Local data on your device is protected by standard Android platform security measures.</p>

    <h2><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></h2>

    <p>This Service does not contain links to external websites, other than the links to the privacy policies of our third-party service providers (Google/Firebase).</p>

    <h2><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></h2>

    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 through our Service. While third-party services might collect device identifiers for functional purposes, we do not intend to use this Service to collect personal data from children. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with information tracked by these services without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information where possible according to the service provider's capabilities. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with information via these third-party services, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.</p>

    <h2><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>

    <h2><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h2>

    <p>Please note that this app is an independent educational tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way associated with the official government agencies responsible for the Einbürgerungstest. While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information based on publicly available resources, we cannot guarantee that the content in this app fully reflects the latest official test questions, formats, or guidelines. Users are encouraged to consult the official resources and websites (such as those provided by BAMF or relevant state authorities) for the most current and authoritative information. Use this app at your own discretion and understand that it serves as a supplementary study aid, not a replacement for official preparation materials or advice from qualified professionals.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:locomotorapps@gmail.com">locomotorapps@gmail.com</a>.</p>
